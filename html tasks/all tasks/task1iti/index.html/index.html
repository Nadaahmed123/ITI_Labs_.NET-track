        A basic page needs only a bare minimum of programming. Graphics are an important part of Web pages but so too are words. I look upon the Web as a medium for ideas and the us eof new technologies, but<br> not the other way around. A Web page tells a great story with great graphical and analytical presentation.

        Using the "View" option look at the soure code for this document. The background color and the text declared in the body refer to a coding system that combines a system of numbers and letters to create<br>
        thousands of possiple color choices. The body color indicates white and the text as bieng black. I could have just written in "white" and "black" instead of these codes.
